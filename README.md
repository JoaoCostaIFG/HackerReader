# HackerReader

**STILL WIP**

A **cli** [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) reader, using the
[HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API).

I mainly created this as a way to play around with
[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/),
[Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss), and consequently
[Go](https://go.dev/). It should be noted that I've barely even seen Go code
before, so expect this to not be that clean.

## TODO

- `[x]` - Load comments;
- `[x]` - Navigate comment tree;
- `[ ]` - Integrate Lip Gloss;
- `[ ]` - Add ability to hide stories/comments;
- `[ ]` - Represent poll results;
- `[x]` - Add ability to open story URLs in the browser;
